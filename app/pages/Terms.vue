      <p><strong>4. ZilPay Account, Install and Set up</strong></p>
      <p>
        4.1 ZilPay<br />
        ZilPay solution is a middleware service that: (i) provides encrypted private keys that you may use to manage your assets from the Blockchain networks in an easy and secure way; (ii) allows Users to create or restore existing wallets
        and to add numerous derived accounts/addresses for each Blockchain platform providing Native and JavaScript SDKs for Users to browse decentralized applications (“DApps”) through the mobile App or WebSite; (iii) allows Users to manage
        their accounts/addresses or to send and receive digital assets; and (iv) provides the access to all transactions detail page and reveal secret phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 Validator<br />
        If ZilPay will operate, at any point in time, a validator or nodes to support the decentralised functioning of various Blockchain networks, it can perform the following Services: (i) select validator to delegate to, (ii) delegate to
        validators to earn staking rewards, (iii) share rewards with delegators (excluding commission), (iv) change delegation, (v) undelegate delegations to validators or (vi) redelegate a portion of your delegation to another validator.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 Create or restore Account<br />
        With ZilPay you have the possibility to either create or restore an existing wallet account in order to use the Services. When you create a new wallet an account/address name will be generated automatically. When you restore an
        existing Wallet you will need to enter the secret phrase in order to access the Services. When you both create or restore a wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to or control over your
        wallet credentials. We shall assume no responsibility for any loss or damage that may be incurred due to the failed recovery of the wallet or not recording the recovery/backup passphrase (security code, recovery code), loss of data,
        erroneous transmission of cryptocurrency, loss of recovery passphrase, leaked ID/password to third parties, and hacking by third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.4 Free of charge<br />
        ZilPay does not currently charge any fees for any of the Services. However, we reserve the right to change this decision at any time and, in that event, all fees will be displayed prior to you using the Services.
      </p>
      <p><strong>5. Account Password and Security</strong></p>
      <p>
        5.1 Private Key<br />
        The private key is a crucial tool for Users, giving the access to the wallet and allowing the transfer to and from that wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key!
      </p>
      <p>
        The User can send or receive digital assets, show the private keys when importing on different wallets, discard the unwanted accounts, and review all the send and receive transactions. For a non-custodial wallet, the User has complete
        control on their assets and complete responsibility for their private key. The wallet is hierarchical deterministic allowing the User to gather various addresses from numerous Blockchains depending on the number of Blockchains in use
        and allows to import the private keys from different wallets.
      </p>
      <p>Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of assets associated with the wallet. ZilPay cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.</p>
      <p>
        5.2 Password and Secret Phrase<br />
        When setting up a ZilPay account, you will be responsible for keeping your own account secrets, which may be a secret phrase, an account file/text, or other locally stored secret information. ZilPay encrypts this information locally
        with a password/pin code you provide, that ZilPay never sends to our servers. You agree (i) to never use the same password/secret phrase for ZilPay that you have used for other services/apps, (ii) keep your secret information and
        password confidential and do not share them with any third parties and (iii) immediately notify ZilPay of any unauthorized use of your ZilPay account or breach of security. ZilPay cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
        arising from your failure to comply with this
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3 Suspicious actions<br />
        You must immediately notify us of any suspicious or unauthorised use of the Services or any other breach of security.
