## Why ZilPay?

ZilPay was created out of the needs of creating more secure and usable Zilliqa-based web sites. In particular, it handles account management and connecting the user to the blockchain.

- Read the full docs of the JSON RPC API,
- Read about other supported APIs,

### Account Management

ZilPay allows users to manage accounts and their keys in a variety of ways, including hardware wallets, while isolating them from the site context.

This security feature also comes with developer convenience: For developers, you simply interact with the globally available Zilliqa API. ZilPay will prompt the user in as comprehensible a way as possible, allowing them to be informed, you to have a simple API.

### Blockchain Connection

ZilPay comes pre-loaded with nice and fast connections to the Zilliqa blockchain. This allows users to get started without synchronizing a full node, while still providing the option to upgrade their security the blockchain provider of their choice over time.

Today, ZilPay is compatible with any blockchain that exposes an Zilliqa Compatible JSON RPC API, including custom and private blockchains. For development, we recommend running a test blockchain like Kaya.

### Blockchain Applications

only ZilPay makes it easy to write user interfaces to blockchain-based smart contract systems. You can accept payments without knowing how to write smart contracts, but youâ€™ll be able to do much more interesting things if you do.
